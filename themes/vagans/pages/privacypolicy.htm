                    <p style="text-align:justify">Canada’s Personal Information Protection And Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) defines “Personal Information” as information about an identifiable individual. Personal Information does not include the name, work title, work address, work telephone or fax number, or electronic address of an employee. PIPEDA requires that your consent be obtained before your Personal Information is collected, used, or disclosed in the course of commercial activities.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">It is also important that you review our Privacy Policy periodically as we may change the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time. Each change made by us will become effective at the time we post notice of the changed terms on our Website or on our App. So please review this Privacy Policy from time to time to see what’s changed – since these changes will apply to you.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">Through our offices in Toronto, Ontario, and our Website, we offer Products and Services related to various matters governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada (“Ontario”).
                        <br>
                        Through our App, we offer a Service to those accused which have been charged with an offence under Ontario’s Highway Traffic Act (“HTA”). One option normally available to such an accused is the right to attend at the local court office in Ontario to dispute the charge and request a trial date. For various reasons, this may be impossible, or inconvenient, for an accused to do.
                        <br>
                        Using the App, a registered user can: (a) retain us and pay our fee; (b) forward a copy of their Ontario Provincial Offence Notice to us which sets out the HTA offence; (c) create the Notice of
                        <br>


                        Appearance document needed by the user to dispute the HTA offence and request a trial date; and (d) have us attend at the local court office in Ontario to file the Notice of Appearance on the
                        user’s behalf. We will then upload a copy of the Notice of Appearance filed with the court into the user’s account.

                        In any case where there may be a cost charged by us to process a request made by you, we will notify you in advance. If we do so, the identified costs must be paid by you to us in advance of our beginning to process such request.
                        <br>
